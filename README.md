### Project startup

The project uses the `pnpm` package manager and commands will be given with it. But you are free to use `npm`.
The project consists of a server part and a front end.

To start the server:

```
cd server/
pnpm i
pnpm run start
```

To start the front end:

```
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
